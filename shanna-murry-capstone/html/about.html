            <h3>About high speed rail:</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/about1.jpeg" class="float-right rounded aboutImg" alt="Anywhere Metro train">
            <p>High-speed rail is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail
                traffic, using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. Lines run in
                excess of 160 miles per hour. High-speed trains normally operate on standard gauge tracks
                of continuously welded rail on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in
                its design.</p>

            <h3>Rail Safety:</h3>
            <p>The focus on rail safety by Anytown Metro comes from many fronts beyond operations including emergency
                preparedness and public awareness. The setup of railway platforms, use of grade crossing signals and
                horn blasts make up a critical system used to communicate movements of commuter trains to pedestrians
                and vehicles. Outside of these operational components, Anytown Metro aggressively pursues safety through
                public
                awareness. Anytown Metro utilizes its own Operation Lifesaver program and uses it to help spread safety
                messages. Anytown Metro also holds events promoting rail safety at schools and organizes a safety poster
                contest
                awarding winners with prizes and features their poster on monthly passes and at stations.</p>

            <p>Anytown Metro has been honored with several E. H. Harriman Awards for employee safety, most recently with
                a
                Bronze award in class B (line-haul railroads with between 4 and 15 million employee hours per year) for
                2005. Previous Harriman Awards conferred to Anytown Metro include Gold awards for 2003 and 2004 and a
                Silver
                award for 2002.</p>

            <h3>Our History:</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/aboutHistory.jpg" class="float-left rounded mr-3 aboutImg" alt="Old tunnel construction">
            <p>Anytown Metro is a commuter railroad in the Anytown metropolitan area. The railroad operates 14 stations
                on 2 different rail lines. It is the twelfth busiest commuter rail system in the United States by
                ridership and the third-largest and busiest commuter rail system outside the New York City metropolitan
                area. There were 37.4 million passenger rides in 2019, up 1.3% from the previous year.</p>

            <p>Using Anytown's rail infrastructure, much of which was created in the 19th century, the Anystate General
                Assembly established the RTA, and later Anytown Metro, to serve commuters by rail. Anytown Metro's
                creation was a result of the anticipated failure of commuter service operated and owned by various
                private railroad companies in the 1970s. Anytown Metro owns all rolling stock and
                is responsible for all stations along with the respective municipalities. Since its inception, Anytown
                Metro has directed more than $5 billion into the commuter rail system of the Anytown metropolitan area.
